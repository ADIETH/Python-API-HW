# Python-APIs-
 - What's the Weather Like?


WeatherPy

In this example, I'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Your objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:


Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


My final notebook have the following:


Randomly selected  500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
Store both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.
